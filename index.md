## Biography

<img align="right" src="image/avatar.jpg">

I am currently a Principal Scientist, Biostatistics, at<a href="http://www.merck.com/index.html/" target="_blank"> Merck & Co.</a> I work on late stage development of oncology studies. I have years of experience leading late phase clinical studies in multiple indications from planning to regulatory submission. I got my Ph.D. degree from <a href="https://sph.uth.edu/divisions/biostatistics/" target="_blank">Department of Biostatistics and Data Science</a>, University of Texas-Health Science Center. My dissertation is *Functional Joint Model of Longitudinal and Time-to-Event data*, advised by <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/sheng.luo" target="_blank">Dr. Sheng Luo</a>. My research interests are Bayesian modeling, Joint model of longitudinal and survival analysis, personalized dynamic prediction, multivariate analysis, and functional data. The methodology developments are mainly motivated by clinical study of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's disease. I am currently also active in statistical topics motivated by oncology studies, including non-proportional hazard design, treatment cross-over, subgroup analysis, and benefit-risk assessment.

You can also find me on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sHHdXr8AAAAJ&hl=en6" target="_blank"> Google Scholar</a> and  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kan_Li9?ev=hdr_xprf" target="_blank"> ResearchGate.</a><br>
