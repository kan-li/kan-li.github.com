Graduate Research Assistant, Department of Biostatistics			                July  2015 – Present

Dissertation: Functional Joint Models: an application to Alzheimer’s disease (AD)

•	Developed methods to incorporate longitudinal functional data in Bayesian joint models framework.

•	Developed Bayesian longitudinal item response theory model to understand AD progression.

•	Investigated approaches to handle computing issues for large-scale data and compute-intensive models.

Project: Personalized Dynamic Prediction of Huntington’s disease (HD) using PREDICT-HD data 

•	Analyzed HD progression using joint model of longitudinal and survival data.

•	Conducted dynamic prediction of future health outcome and risk of HD progression for early diagnosis.

•	Developed Web-based App of [HD prediction tool](https://kanli.shinyapps.io/HD_prediction/) for clinical use. 

Project: Longitudinal analyses of National Parkinson Foundation Quality Improvement Initiative data 

•	Fitted multilevel linear/generalized linear mixed models to examine the effect of consistent exercise and physical therapy to mobility and health-related quality of life in people with PD. 

•	Prepared statistical reports for non-statistical medical researchers and revised analysis based on their feedback accordingly.
